## Challenges (Complete at least one):
* Add a second rectangle that changes color only when you click on the second rectangle.
    * *Hint: you may need to use one of the built in mouse functions or variables in P5JS. https://p5js.org/search/?term=mouse may help*
* Create a button that works the same as the first but is a circle rather than a rectangle.
* Create an small unclickable button that when you try to hover over it, the button moves away from the mouse, so it can never be clicked or hovered over.
